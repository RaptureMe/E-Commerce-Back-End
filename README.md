# E-Commerce Back End
  
  ## Description 
  
  This project was set up so that we can create routes to GET, POST, DELETE and PUT data about our E Commerce store. The project uses sequalize, express and routes to show data. Through insomnia we can see how the data can be used through the different routes.
